# CSNET

CSNET is a C application programming library for communicating over a SCION network. More information about SCION can be
found [here](https://docs.scion.org/en/latest/overview.html). CSNET exposes
a [BSD-socket-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets) API to send and receive
SCION packets. CSNET provides similar functionalities
to [snet (Go)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/scionproto/scion/pkg/snet), [PAN (Go)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/netsec-ethz/scion-apps/pkg/pan), [JPAN (Java)](https://github.com/scionproto-contrib/jpan)
and
[scion-rs (Rust)](https://github.com/MystenLabs/scion-rs).

### Feature Summary:

- Linux, MacOS and ESP32 support
- UDP over SCION
- SCMP (ICMP for SCION)
- Explicit SCION path selection
- SCION ping tool

To get started with CSNET follow the building and installation instructions below and afterward continue with
the [Getting Started Guide](./docs/getting-started.md).

## Requirements

Building and installing the library and examples requires CMake 3.22 or newer
(download [here](https://cmake.org/download/)).

All the requirements for building the library and examples are fetched automatically with CMake and installed in the
workspace build directory, ensuring the rest of the system remains unaffected.

Running the examples (in `./examples`) additionally requires the following:

- a running local SCION Network (see [Local SCION Network Setup](#local-scion-network-setup) for setup instructions)
- some examples have additional requirements, consult the [README](./examples/README.md) for more information

Building the documentation (in `./docs`) requires:

- doxygen (download [here](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html))
- graphviz (download [here](https://graphviz.org/download/))

## Building and Installation

Setup the CMake build directory in `./dist` with

```bash
cmake -DBUILD_LIB=ON -DBUILD_CMD=ON -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DBUILD_DOCS=OFF -B dist
```

The following options exist:

- `BUILD_LIB`: build the library in `./lib`
- `BUILD_CMD`: build the command line tools in `./cmd`
- `BUILD_EXAMPLES`: build the examples in `./examples`.
- `BUILD_TESTS`: build the tests in `./tests`, the cmd tools in `./cmd` and some of the examples in
  `./examples` that serve as E2E tests. This means that even if `BUILD_EXAMPLES` is `OFF` some examples may still be
  built if `BUILD_TESTS` is
  `ON`. The same holds for `BUILD_CMD`.
- `BUILD_DOCS`: build the docs which are output to `./docs/api`.

Build everything with

```bash
cmake --build dist
```

To install the library execute:

```bash
 cmake --install dist --prefix "your installation directory"
```

Depending on the installation directory you might need to run the command with `sudo`.

The installation will produce the static libraries `lib/libscion.a`, `lib/libnghttp2.a`, `lib/libprotobuf.a`, the header
file `include/scion/scion.h` and the command-line tool `bin/ping` in your installation directory. When using the library
make sure to link against all the static libraries produced by the installation.

### Known Issues

- On ARM you might get `clang++: error: unsupported option '-msse4.1' for target 'arm64-apple-darwin24.4.0` when
  building. This is a known issue and we have to wait for a version bump in protobuf (
  discussion [here](https://github.com/scionproto-contrib/csnet/pull/41#issuecomment-2895630253)).

## Local SCION Network Setup

Requirements:

- Linux, MacOS or WSL
- Go 1.23 or newer (download [here](https://go.dev/dl/))

To set up a local SCION Network execute the setup script in `scripts/setup-network.sh`. After successfully installing
it, the network can be started with `scripts/run-testnet.sh`. Press `Ctrl+C` to shut down the test network.

## ESP32

EPS32 specific instructions can be found [here](./esp32/README.md).

## Library Development

### Requirements

Required tools:

- `protobuf` and `protobuf-c`: Protobuf to C compiler required to generate code from .proto files to talk to a control
  server.
- (optionally) `clang-format`: Code formatter we use.

### Code Quality

To automatically format the code install `clang-format` (e.g., via Homebrew) and run

```
find . -iname "*.h" -o -iname "*.c"  | xargs clang-format -i
```

Individual sections can be excluded from formatting like follows:

```
// clang-format off
...
// clang-format on
```

Entire files and directories are ignored by adding them to `.clang-format-ignore`
