/*
 * FUNCTION: scion_fetch_paths
 * -----------------
 * Returns a list of available paths between a SCION network and a given destination AS by
 * fetching the required path segments from the local Control Server.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *      - struct scion_network *network: Pointer to the SCION network.
 *      - ScionIA dst: destination AS.
 *      - struct scion_linked_list *paths: Pointer to a scion_linked_list into which the resulting scion_path structs,
 *        which represent the available paths, will be stored.
 *
 * Returns:
 *      - An integer status code, 0 for success or an error code as defined in error.h.
